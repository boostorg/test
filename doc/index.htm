          of components for writing test programs, organizing tests in to simple

            exception and error detection and reporting facility for use in both
            production and test programs. The Execution Monitor calls a user-supplied
            function and reports all caught runtime exceptions. It is used internally
            by other Boost Test Library components. It also could be used in some
            production environment to make controlled calls of functions which
            might otherwise crash the program.</LI>

          the original testing library used in a Boost. These are several simple
          steps you need to follow to smoothly migrate to the latest software.</P>
        <P class="1-line-indented">If your code were using the original version
          of cpp_main facility, to migrate you will need to delete the inclusion
          of the &lt;boost/test/cpp_main.cpp&gt;, since this file is not present
          any more. After that you have following choices:</P>
        <ul>
          <li>Link with Program Execution Monitor (exact library name depends
            on compiler you are using, but most probably it will be libprg_exec_monitor.lib).
          </li>
          <li>Include &lt;boost/test/included/prg_exec_monitor.hpp&gt;, in which
            case you need not link with precompiled component but it may incur
            probably some compile time overhead.</li>

        <P class="1-line-indented">If your code were using the original version
          of test_main and test tools facilitates of Boost.Test library, to migrate

          <li>Without changing of the code that were using Boost.Test facilities
            link with Test Execution Monitor (exact library name depends on compiler
            you are using, but most probably it will be libtest_exec_monitor.lib).</li>

            could be deleted either.</li>
          <li>Include &lt;boost/test/minimal.hpp&gt;, in which case you need not link
            with precompiled component and it most probably does not incur a compile
            time overhead, but you will be limited ti the set of features defined
            in the original test library. Definition of BOOST_INCLUDE_MAIN could
            be deleted either. Would you decide in a future to use any of newer

          a bare minimum.</P>
